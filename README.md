- 👋 Hi, I’m @gelastropod
- 👀 Interests:
I’m interested in mostly graphics programming, though I also sometimes delve into game development and simulations as a side project. My most-used graphics engine is OpenGL (glfw, c++). However, I do sometimes use JavaFX.
- 🌱 Current projects:
[satisfactory-minecraft](https://github.com/gelastropod/satisfactory-minecraft.git): A minecraft mod aiming to develop the game Satisfactory
[ADClone](https://github.com/gelastropod/ADClone.git): A project aiming to code Antimatter Dimensions in JavaFX, for me to test my JavaFX skills
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any modding (minecraft) projects anyone is interested in!
- 📫 How to reach me: I am probably most active on discord, username: gelastropod
- 😄 Pronouns: he
- ⚡ Fun fact: I play Nomifactory, and a lot of incremental idle games :)
